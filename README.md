Angular Intro
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

    is a typescript framework used to develop Single Page Applications.

    Dynamic Web App

        Server                                                      Client (Browser)

            server side
            executing programs 
            (controllers)
            and view engines
                                    html content is generated by
                                    the view engine on the server
                                    ----------generated html (RESP)------->  unload the prev page and load the new one.

            spa-bundle
            (index.html + JS)

                                                                    load the index.html and
                                                                    load the JS assosiated with it.

                                                                    from now on we won't contact the server any more.
                                                                    all events, form submitions ..etc

                                                                   JS will generate html if needed on the client and
                                                                   will replace the old html content of index with the

                                                                   in case of a data operation like
                                                                   retrival or insertion or updation or deletion

                                                                    and will generated html suitable for that data
                                                                    and will render that html on the index.html

                return this.salary*percent ;
            }
        }

    Lab Setup

        VS Code             IDE                     latest
        NodeJS              Dev.Platform            14 >                                            node --version
        Angular CLI         Project Tool Facet      13 >    npm install -g @angular/cli@13.3.3      ng version

    What is Node?
        NodeJS is a javascript runtime alternate to a browser.

    Why is NodeJS?

        1. Compose the code                     IDE             VSCode
        2. Compile the code (.ts into .js)      transpeller     babel
        3. build the bundle (dependencies)      build tool      npm
        4. pack the bundle                      packaging tool  webpack
        5. run test cases                       testing lib     jasmine and karma

        all these tools like babel, npm, webpack, jasmine are expected to execute on the developer machine.
        and all of thee tools are javascript based. Hence we need NodeJS on the developer machine to execute these tools.

    Angular CLI

        it is frontier of npm tool adn other build scripts to create and manage the project structure and is used
        to invoke the testing, executing or building of our application.

        ng new proj-name

        cd proj-name

        proj-name \>    ng generate module ModuleName
        proj-name \>    ng generate directive DirectiveName --skip-tests
        proj-name \>    ng generate component ComponentName --skip-tests
        proj-name \>    ng generate pipe PipeName --skip-tests
        proj-name \>    ng generate service ServiceName --skip-tests
        proj-name \>    ng generate class ClassName --skip-tests
        proj-name \>    ng generate interface InterfaceName

        'generate' can be short-cut to 'g'
        'component' can be short-cut to 'c'

        proj-name \>    ng serve --port 8999 -o
        proj-name \>    ng build
        proj-name \>    ng test


Angular Archetecture
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

    an angular project comprises of variaty of resources like :

        Modules
        Directives
        Components
        Pipes
        Services

    each of these resources is a typescript class.
    these class are marked with decorators to specify their role.
    these decorators are also supplied with a json-object called meta-data that
    encapsulates the configuration of each resource.

    Module
            @NgModule({
                declarations:[],
                imports:[],
                exports:[],
                providers:[],
                bootstrap:[]
            })
            class SalesModule {

            }

            An angular module is different from a JS module.
            Each JS file is a is a JS module. 
            Each angular module is a class. The anulgar module are a logical group of single unit of
            load. an Angular module will group components, directives, pipes and services as a unit.
            An angular module can have sub-modules as well.

            Each angular project must be inside a top-level module and is called 'ROOT-MODULE'
            and the sub-module are called 'FEATURE-MODULES'

            declarations    will hold the list of components,directives,pipes that
                            are grouped under the current module

            imports         will hold the list of sub-modules needed in the current module     

            exports         will hold the list of components,directives,pipes that
                            are grouped under the current module and are allowed 
                            to be accessed outside the current module.

                            'exports' is absent for 'ROOT-MODULE'

            providers       will hold the list of servcies of the current module.

            bootstrap       is a meta-data property allowed only for top-level modules,
                            and will have the component that has to be instatiated immediatly 
                            after the module is loaded.
            

    Directive

            Angular allows extandability on html - that one can create our own html elements (tags) and attributes.

            Component Directives / Components

                @Component({
                    selector:'',
                    templateUrl:''
                })
                class ShoppingCartComponent {

                }

                Each component is a html element (tag).

                selector    is the name of the tag

                Component = Component Class + Component Template + Component Style Sheets
                    Component Class holds the state (data) and behaviour (method for event-handling)
                    Component Template provide the html DOM for that compenent.
                    Component Style Sheets provide local styling...

                Data Binding

                    is about accessing the fields and methods of componenet class in
                    the component template.

                    Interpolation
                        is rendering the value of an angular expression into the
                        content of a html element.

                        {{angular-expression}}

                        as and when the fields in the expression have their valeus changed,
                        the expression is autoamtically re-evaluated and updated on the screen.
                        
                    Two-Way Data Binding
                    One-Way Data Binding

            Structural Directives
            Attribute Directives
                @Direcitve({
                    selector:''
                })
                class FastMovingStockDirective {

                }
            




    Pipe
            @Pipe({
                name:''
            })
            class HighLighter {

            }

    Service
            @Injectable({
                providedIn:'root'
            })
            class SalesService {

            }
